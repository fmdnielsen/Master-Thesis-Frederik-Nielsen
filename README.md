This repository contains the code used for my master's thesis. 

The thesis title is "Predictive Modelling of Electricity Consumption: A Comparative Study Across Multiple Consumer Types"

The "Models" folder contains all the Jupytor notebook files for the implemented machine-learning models, as well as the trained models.
The "Original data" folder contains the original data used for forecasting before any cleaning.
The "Data cleaning" folder contains the Python scripts used for data cleaning and feature engineering. 
The "Clean data" folder contains the cleaned datasets used for forecasting.


To gain a better understanding of the implementation, it's important to have knowledge of the following abbreviations:
res = residential
ind = industrial
cam = institutional (campus)

LSTM = Stacked LSTM
LSTM_simple = LSTM
