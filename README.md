This repository contains the code used for my master's thesis. 

The thesis title is "Predictive Modelling of Electricity Consumption: A Comparative Study Across Multiple Consumer Types" <br />

The "Models" folder contains all the Jupytor notebook files for the implemented machine-learning models, as well as the trained models. <br />
The "Original data" folder contains the original data used for forecasting before any cleaning. <br />
The "Data cleaning" folder contains the Python scripts used for data cleaning and feature engineering.  <br />
The "Clean data" folder contains the cleaned datasets used for forecasting. <br />


To gain a better understanding of the implementation, it's important to have knowledge of the following abbreviations: <br />
res = residential <br />
ind = industrial <br />
cam = institutional (campus) <br />

LSTM = Stacked LSTM <br />
LSTM_simple = Basic LSTM with only 1 LSTM layer
